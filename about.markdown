My name is [Roberto Casta√±eda Lozano](https://robcasloz.github.io/). This blog focuses on programming language implementation (compilers, program analysis, etc.), but might also cover other software topics I find interesting, such as combinatorial optimization and testing.

I currently work at Oracle as an [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/) compiler engineer. The views expressed on this blog are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my employer.
